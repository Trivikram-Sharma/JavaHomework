1. WHY WE HAVE TO CLOSE SCANNER OBJECT using obj.close();
Ans:   Scanner object is closed once the reading of input is done, so that the memory is freed up to accomodate othere variables etc.

2. Why we got error when we wrote obj.nextInt() in product class, 

   which we had to change to:

                  Integer.Parse(obj.nextLine());
Ans: The error occurs as the input is taken including the next line, which is not going to be integer even after conversion/typecasting etc., as per the nextInt() method. Thus, nextLine() method was used with wrapper class instead.

3. Can we create static class?
Ans: Static classes might be created only if the class is defined inside another class.
